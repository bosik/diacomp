		<h2>2. Collection and use of Personal Information</h2>
		<p>Personal Information collection:</p>
		<p>2.1.	Information that you provide by filling in forms in the mobile application. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our mobile application.</p>

		<p>Personal Information use:</p>

		<p>2.4.	We use personal information collected through Diacomp account to enable the services provided through Diacomp and as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>2.5.	We may need to share personal information in order (i) to comply with the law (e.g. a legal process or a statutory authorization), (ii) to protect or enforce our rights, or (iii) as part of a reorganization, consolidation, merger, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of Diacomp.</p>
		<h2>3. Data protection</h2>
		<p>3.1.	Mobile App can be downloaded via an Online Store - a registration is necessary for this. The Online Store's privacy policy, which Diacomp has no influence over, applies hereby.</p>
		<p>3.2.	The following data shall be required during the use of the services of the Mobile App: email address, gender, date of birth, diabetes type. The data is saved primarily on the end device of the client. During the existing Internet connection the above indicated data shall be transferred to Diacomp and stored on our secure servers for backup and storage purposes. Where you have chosen (or where we have given you) a password which enables you to access Mobile App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

		<h2>4. Information Security</h2>
		<p>4.1 We work hard to protect Diacomp and our clients from unauthorized access to the information we hold. In particular we use account activation tool to verify the email address for new account creation in the Mobile App.</p>
		<h2>5. Providing links to other websites</h2>
		<p>5.1. At this point we do not provide links to other web sites. But in all likelihood we will have advertisements in the future. That is how we keep this free for the clients. Diacomp may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you in the future. Because we do not control unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your personal information and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this privacy policy.</p>
		<h2>6. Changes to Diacomp Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>6.1.	Your registration into our Mobile App means that you are accepting the practices set forth in this policy. We reserve the right to make changes to the policy by posting the new version with a new effective date.</p>
		<p>6.2.	We have the right to amend this Private Policy at any time, without prior notice to each User. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted here. Where appropriate, we will notify you by e-mail or seek your consent. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>
